    <title>The Coordinate Plane</title>
    <p>The <term>Cartesian coordinate plane</term> is formed by drawing perpendicular coordinate axes starting at a point called the <term>origin</term>. The location of a point <m>\mathcal{P}</m> in the plane is determined by an <term>ordered pair</term> of real numbers <m>(x,y)</m> called its <term>coordinates</term>. The first coordinate <m>x</m> of the pair determines the location of <m>\mathcal{P}</m> along the horizontal axis and the second coordinate <m>y</m> of the pair determines its location along the vertical axis.   
    <image source="images/graphing/coordinateplane" width="50%"/>
    The origin <m>\mathcal{O}</m> has coordinates <m>(0,0)</m>. Points on the <m>x</m>-axis have coordinates <m>\mathcal{Q}(x,0)</m>, with the second coordinate zero. Similarly, points on the <m>y</m>-axis have coordinates <m>\mathcal{R}(0,y)</m>, with the first coordinate zero.</p>

        is a point in the plane and

        is a positive real number. The circle centered at

        with radius 
        <m>r</m>
        consists of all points

        satisfying

        <image source="images/graphing/circle" width="50%"/>

    <title>Graphing Equations</title>
    <p>Consider the equation 
          
      <men xml:id="eqn-unit-circle">x^2+y^2 = 1</men>
      with two variables 
      <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. Solutions to the equation are points <m>(x,y)</m> that make the equation TRUE. (See <xref ref="section-what-are-equations"/>.)
      The set of all points in the coordinate plane that satisfy the equation is called the <term>graph of the equation</term>. For instance, 
      <m>\mathcal{P}(1,0)</m> satisfies <xref ref="eqn-unit-circle"/>
      <me>1^2 + 0^2 = 1</me>
      so that <m>\mathcal{P}(1,0)</m> is a point on the graph of the equation. Consider <m>\mathcal{Q}\left(0,-1\right)</m>
      <me>0^2 + \left(-1\right)^2 = 0+1 = 1,</me>
      so that <m>\mathcal{Q}</m> is on the graph of the equation. Similarly,
      <me>\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4} =  1</me>
      so that <m>\mathcal{R}\left(-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)</m>
      is also on the graph. If we plot these three solutions in the coordinate plane we obtain just a portion of the graph of 
      <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>.  
      <image source="images/graphing/graphing1" width="50%"/>
      To better understand the graph of this equation, we can rewrite things as

        <mrow>x^2+y^2 \amp= 1</mrow>
        <mrow>(x-0)^2+(y-0)^2 \amp= 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-0)^2} \amp= 1</mrow></md>The left side looks like the Distance Formula 
      <xref ref="eqn-distance-formula"/>.
      This says that <m>(x,y)</m> is a solution precisely when the distance between <m>(x,y)</m> and the origin <m>(0,0)</m> is <m>1</m>. The set of all points that are one unit from the origin forms a circle centered at the origin with radius 
      <m>1</m> and it is this circle which is the graph of <m>x^2+y^2 = 1</m>. We call this the <term>unit circle</term>.

<section xml:id="section-slope-rates">
    <title>Slope and Rates of Change</title>

    <p>Linear equations can provide simple models of real-life scenarios. The essential feature of a linear model is a <em>constant rate of change</em> determined by the <em>slope</em> of the line.</p>

    <example>
      <title>Linear Model of Data</title>
      <p>Researchers collected data on the number of hours students studied for an important professional certification exam. They performed a common statistical technique called 
      <em>linear regression</em>
      to establish a best-fit linear model of the data and found the linear relationship 
      <me>S = 4.5H + 40,</me>
      where <m>H</m> is the number of hours studied and <m>S</m> is the predicted score on the exam.
      <image source="images/graphing/lines3" width="50%"/>
      For each hour of studying, the model predicts an increased score of <m>4.5</m> points. This <term>rate of change</term> of <m>4.5</m> <em>points per hour</em>
      is seen graphically in the steepness or <term>slope</term> of the graph of the line.</p>
    </example>


    <definition xml:id="definition-slope-of-line">
      <title>Slope of a Line</title>
      <p>The <term>slope <m>m</m> of a line</term> in the coordinate plane is the ratio of the change in <m>y</m> over the change in <m>x</m> between any two 
      <em>different</em> points on the line. 
      <image source="images/graphing/slope" width="50%"/>
      Precisely, suppose <m>\mathcal{P}(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>\mathcal{Q}(x_2,y_2)</m>
      are two points on a line with <m>x_1 \neq x_2</m>. Then

    </definition>

    <p>The symbol <m>m</m> is commonly used for the slope of a line. The vertical change in <m>y</m> is often called the <em>rise</em> and is denoted <m>\Delta y</m>, where the Greek letter &quot;delta&quot; is used to indicate change (difference). Similarly, horizontal change in <m>x</m> is often called the 
    <em>run</em> and is denoted <m>\Delta x</m>.</p>

          <image source="images/graphing/slope2" width="50%"/>The slope is negative, indicating that an

            units</em>in the

      <title>Horizontal and Vertical Lines</title>
      <p>The graph of a linear equation of the form 
        <m>y=k</m> is a <em>horizontal</em> line and its slope is zero. This is because a change in <m>x</m> results in no change in <m>y</m>. On the other hand, a linear equation of the form <m>x=h</m> is a <em>vertical</em> line and its slope is <em>undefined</em>. This is because the change in the

    <title>Linear Models</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>Linear equations are frequently used to construct simple models of the interaction between two quantities. We will illustrate this with a few examples below. Think about the appropriate choice of linear form in each example. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Standard Form: <m>Ax+By = C</m></li>
          <li>Point-Slope Form: <m>y-y_0 = m(x-x_0)</m></li>
          <li>Slope-Intercept Form: <m>y = mx+b</m></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>A rectangular fence is to be constructed from a fixed budget of 1000 dollars. Two parallel sides of the fence are constructed from a material costing 4 dollars per foot, while the remaining sides are constructed from a material costing 3 dollars per foot. Express these constraints as a linear equation.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Let 
          <m>x</m>
          denote the length of the sides costing 4 dollars per foot and let 
          <m>y</m>
          denote the length of the sides costing 3 dollars per foot. Then the cost of the fence is 
          <m>4x+4x+3y+3y = 8x + 6y</m>. The fixed budget imposes the linear constraint
          <me>8x+6y = 1000.</me></p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>A gasoline-powered generator has a fuel tank capacity of 
          <m>10</m>
          gallons and consumes fuel at a rate 
          <m>1.5</m>
          gallons per hour. Find a linear model for the fuel consumption over time. How long can the generator run on a full tank?</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Let 
          <m>y</m>
          be the amount of fuel in the tank after running for 
          <m>x</m> hours. Then initially, 
          <m>y=10</m>, when 
          <m>x=0</m>, determining the 
          <m>y</m>-intercept. The rate of decrease of fuel provides the slope 
          <m>-1.5</m>. So,
          <me>y = -1.5x + 10.</me> The tank will be empty when
          <me>0 = -1.5x + 10</me>
          which we solve to find

          hours.</p>

    <example>
      <statement><p>
      A company earns a revenue of <m>\$1000</m> from selling <m>25</m> units of their product. They earn <m>\$1650</m> from selling <m>41</m> units. Find a linear relationship modeling the revenue in terms of number of units sold.
    </p></statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Let <m>R</m> denote the revenue and <m>x</m> denote the number of units sold. 
      <image source="images/graphing/revenue" width="50%"/>
      The data provided allows us to find the rate at which revenue changes as we increase the number of units sold:
      <me>\frac{\Delta R}{\Delta x} = \frac{1650-1000}{41-25} = \frac{650}{16} = 40.625</me>
      So the slope of our line is <m>m = 40.625</m> dollars per unit. We can now use point-slope form along with either data point to find a linear equation

        <mrow>R - 1000 \amp= 40.625(x-25)</mrow>

    <title>Parabolas</title>

    <p>A <term>parabola</term> is a curve that is defined by a special geometric property. Every point on a parabola is the same distance from a special point called its <term>focus</term> and a special line called its <term>directrix</term>. In the figure below the focus is labeled <m>F</m> and the directrix is labeled <m>l</m>. The parabola is the <q>U</q>-shaped curve. Observe the equal distances to the focus and directrix at the two points illustrated on the curve. The point <m>V</m> at the base of <q>U</q>-shape is called the <term>vertex</term> of the parabola.
    </p>
    <image source="images/graphing/parabola-wp" width="50%"/>
    
    <example>
      <!-- <statement> -->
      <p>Let's find an equation for the parabola with focus at <m>F(0,1)</m> and directrix <m>y = -1</m>.</p>
      <image source="images/graphing/parabola1" width="50%"/>
      <!-- </statement>
      <solution> -->
        <p>
      Suppose <m>P(x,y)</m> is a point on the parabola. Then the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>F</m> is given by the Distance Formula (<xref ref="eqn-distance-formula"/>).
      <me>\overline{PF} = \sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-1)^2} = \sqrt{x^2+(y-1)^2}.</me>
      The distance from <m>P</m> to the line <m>y = -1</m> is <m>\overline{Pl} = y+1</m>. These distances must be equal so that
      <me>\sqrt{x^2+(y-1)^2} = y+1.</me>
      Squaring both sides gives
      <me>x^2+(y-1)^2 = (y+1)^2.</me>
      Expanding the squared terms
      <me>x^2+y^2-2y+1 = y^2+2y+1</me>
      Canceling common terms from both sides:
      <me>x^2-2y = 2y </me>
      And combining like terms:
      <me>x^2 = 4y</me>
      So that
      <me>y = \frac{1}{4} x^2</me>
      is an equation for our parabola.

    <example>
      <statement><p>
        Graph the parabola <m>y = -2 x^2+5 x+3</m> by finding the intercepts of the graph.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>To find where the graph intersects the <m>x</m>-axis, we need to set <m>y=0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>. This can be done, in this case, via factoring:
        <md>
          <mrow>-2 x^2+5 x+3 \amp= 0</mrow>
          <mrow>-(2 x^2-5 x-3 \amp= 0</mrow>
          <mrow>-(2x+1)(x-3) \amp= 0</mrow>
        </md>
        So that <m>2x+1=0</m> OR <m>x-3 = 0</m>. This gives <m>x</m>-intercepts at <m>(-1/2,0)</m> and <m>(3,0)</m>. </p>
        <p>To find where the graph intersects the <m>y</m>-axis, we need to evaluate at <m>x=0</m>. We have
        <me>y = -2 (0)^2+5(0)+3 = 3,</me>
        so that <m>(0,3)</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept. Since the leading coefficient is negative, the parabola will open down.
        <image source="images/graphing/parabola2" width="50%"/>
        The vertex can be found equidistant from the two <m>x</m>-intercepts. To find its <m>x</m>-coordinate, average
        <me>\frac{-\frac{1}{2}+3}{2} = \frac{-1+6}{4} = \frac{5}{4}.</me>
        To find the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the vertex, evaluate
        <md>
          <mrow>y \amp= -2 \left(\frac{5}{4}\right)^2 + 5 \left(\frac{5}{4}\right)+ 3</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= -2 \left(\frac{25}{16}\right) + \frac{25}{4}+ 3</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= -\frac{50}{16} + \frac{25}{4}+ 3</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= -\frac{25}{8} + \frac{50}{8}+ \frac{24}{8}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= \frac{-25+50+24}{8} </mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= \frac{49}{8} </mrow>
