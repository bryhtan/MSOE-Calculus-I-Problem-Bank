We refer to the collection of all real numbers as the set of real numbers and denote this by the symbol . Within the set of real numbers are special categories of numbers you should be familiar with. The set of natural numbers includes the counting numbers and zero: If we also include their opposite , we obtain the set of integers : If we form ratios of integers, i.e. fractions involving integers, we obtain the set of rational numbers .   Rational Numbers   The following real numbers are rational numbers: Every integer is a rational number as it can be written as a ratio in many ways. For example, Even zero is a rational number, since dividing zero by any non-zero integer results in zero:     Division by Zero is Undefined  You must never divide a real number by zero . Expressions such as or are considered to be undefined in that they are assigned no numeric value and have no mathematical meaning.  Division into zero by a non-zero real number is permitted and results in zero. For instance, .   A real number which is not rational is called an irrational number.

  "body": " Terms versus Factors  This section emphasizes the importance of correctly identifying the parts of an algebraic expression. Carefully use the words \"term\" and \"factor\" accurately to avoid many pitfalls in algebra.  Repeated addition of a number gives a multiple of that number. Each occurrence of the number is a term in the sum.  Repeated Addition  In this case, there are 5 terms of 2 resulting in 10.    Repeated multiplication of a number gives a power of that number. Each occurrence of the number is a factor in the product.   Repeated Multiplication  In this case, there are 5 factors of 2 resulting in 32. The number of factors, , in the power is called its exponent . The number in the power is called the base of the power.   Terms and Factors  Whenever we add (or subtract) real numbers the individual numbers are called terms in the sum. Whenever we multiply (or divide) real numbers the numbers are called factors in the product. An expression of the form is called a power with base  and exponent  .   Canceling   It's crucial that you distinguish between terms in a sum versus factors in a product . For instance, you may cancel the common factors of in the ratio: However, you must never cancel common terms in a ratio. For instance, do not cancel the common terms of in the ratio . Instead,  If is a real number, then is its opposite value and appears at the same, but opposite location on the real line. I recommend you resist the urge to refer to as negative  as it is unclear if the result is positive or negative. For instance, the opposite of is , a positive integer. Adding a number with its opposite results in zero: It is for this reason that is sometimes called the additive inverse of .  If is non-zero (see ) real number, then is called its reciprocal . Multiplying by its reciprocal results in one: It is for this reason that is sometimes called the multiplicative inverse of . For instance, is the multiplicative inverse of because .

For instance, is not in the domain of because evaluating at would result in division by zero, which is undefined. (See .) There are two things to consider when determining the domain of an expression.  Algebraic Constraints: What constraints must be placed on the variables to ensure the result is a sensible real number? For instance, we should avoid division by zero or square roots of negative numbers.  Practical Constraints: What constraints does the context or application put on the variables? For example, if a variable represents a measured length, then it would be reasonable to require it to only take positive values.     Algebraic Constraints on Domain   Find the domain of each algebraic expression             The operation of subtracting from may be performed to any real number. Thus, the domain is the set of all real numbers which we could write as or in interval notation as .   Since a square root is now involved, we must require . Equivalently, . Thus, the domain is the interval .   Additionally, we require that we never divide by zero. This requires and the domain is now the open interval .   As before, we require that . But squaring any real number results in a non-negative quantity and adding will guarantee the result is positive. Thus, the domain is the set of all real numbers  We require that . This means . So the domain is the set of all points in the coordinate plane with .       Practical Constraints on Domain   You are to make an open top rectangular box from a flat piece of inch cardboard. To do so, make equal length cuts at the corners to remove square pieces and then fold up the sides to make a box. Find an algebraic expression for the volume of the box involving the variable representing the depth of the cuts at each corner. What is the domain of the expression?      The height of the box is determined by the depth of the cuts .  The width of the box is inches.  The length of the box is inches.  So the volume is given by As a purely algebraic expression, the domain is as there is nothing preventing us from evaluating the expression above at any real number . However, the physical constraints require the cuts be no deeper than the halfway point on the shortest side. So, and the domain is the interval .     Domain and Simplification  Sometimes simplifying an expression will appear to change its domain. For example, But this equation is only true for as the left side is not defined for .

The height of the box is determined by the depth of the cuts .  The width of the box is inches.  The length of the box is inches.  So the volume is given by As a purely algebraic expression, the domain is as there is nothing preventing us from evaluating the expression above at any real number . However, the physical constraints require the cuts be no deeper than the halfway point on the shortest side. So, and the domain is the interval .   "

  "title": "What Are Equations?",
  "body": " What Are Equations?  This might seem like a silly question, but it's important to address clearly. An equation is a mathematical statement involving equality that evaluates as either TRUE or FALSE. The following equation is TRUE because the values on either side of the equal sign are the same. On the other hand, the equation is FALSE. An algebraic equation is an equation involving one or more variables. For instance, is an algebraic equation in three variables. The equation is TRUE or FALSE depending on what value the variables take. If then it is FALSE, but if , then it is TRUE.  To solve an equation , means to find all possible values of the variable(s) that make the equation TRUE. These values are called solutions of the equation. For instance, the equation has two solutions AND . The solution set is the set of all solutions of the equation. In this case, the solution set is , where it is common to enclose the solutions in curly braces. On the other hand, the equation has no (real number) solutions, so that its solution set is the empty set, .  When solving an equation, we usually do so by replacing it with an equivalent equation , that is, with an equation with the same solution set. Performing operations of addition or multiplication by the same value to both sides of an equation generally results in an equivalent equation. The following example illustrates this in the case of a linear equation .   Solving a Linear Equation  To solve , we replace it with a sequence of equivalent equations. showing that is the unique solution to the original equation.   It is not necessary to write as much as the previous example might suggest. The following would be suitable in the college classroom.   Solving a Linear Equation  Solve the linear equation .

This is a practice you should adhere to throughout your college mathematics courses. Compare this advice with .    Solving a Linear Equation   Solve for .     If we multiply both sides by 4, we will clear the fractions.    Avoid Losing Solutions  Be cautious when performing algebraic operations as the domain of the expressions involved may change resulting in a non-equivalent equation. This can lead to lost solutions or extraneous values that are not solutions to the original equation. For example, the equation is not equivalent to as dividing both sides by assumed it was non-zero. Doing so lost a solution to the first equation of .   Are the following pairs of equations equivalent? That is, do they have the same solution set? Why or why not.  and   and    "

  "body": " Introduction to Functions  The notion of a function is possibly the most important and useful concepts in all of mathematics. Generally speaking, a function is some sort of relationship or rule that takes an input and assigns it to a distinct output . I like to think of it as a machine that converts an input to its output.   Make and Model   To illustrate with an everyday example, there is a functional relationship between the model of an automobile and its make. The input to the function is the model of a car, while the output is the corresponding manufacturer of that particular car. For example, if I told you that I drive a Civic , you could then determine (perhaps after a little research) that my car is manufactured by Honda . In this case, we say that the make of a car is a function of the model .  Notice that this example doesn't work the other way. If I told you I drive a Honda you could not determine the model of the car from that information alone. The model of a car is NOT a function of the make .  In algebra and calculus we are mostly interested in functions whose inputs and outputs are real numbers. These are so-called real-valued functions of a real variable.    A real-valued function  of a real variable is a rule which assigns to each real number input from a set called the domain of to a unique real number output . We call the value of evaluated at . The range of is the set of all outputs , where is from the domain of .      We need to refer to the function by some name, a symbol like , but it could be anything you prefer for the situation. If we input a number , then we call the corresponding output , which we read as of or at . Visualize as a machine that converts an inputted real number to a real number output . The process of determining the output of a function from an input is called evaluation .   Evaluating the Squaring Function  The statement: tells us that we are defining a function whose name is . It takes a real number input and outputs its square . We call the squaring function . We may evaluate at various real numbers. For example, evaluating at we would write: Notice the use of parenthesis to ensure the correct order of operations . Visually, Some other examples of evaluating give:   Since we are allowed to input any real number , the domain of is assumed to be . The result of squaring a real number is a non-negative number. Thus, the range of is .    A function from data  The population of Madison, Wisconsin is provided in the table below (Source: US Decennial Census).   Year Population    1980 170,616    1990  191,262    2000  208,054    2010  233,209    2020  269,840   To use the table, we choose a year (the input) and read the population (the output). Thus, the population is a function of the year .  To make this formal, let be the population, where is the number of years since 1980 (this is a preference to avoid working with large numbers). To illustrate, Strictly speaking, the domain of this function consists only of the years for which we have data, so the domain is the set   You might want to infer values in between those years, or predict future values from this data, but once you do this, you are now modeling the data with a different function. For example, it looks like the population is increasing about 20,000 people per decade, or about 2000 people per year. (This is a very crude estimate!) So we could construct a second linear function to model the population. Our model says the population in 2020 should be compared to the census population . The domain of the model is likely interpreted as the interval presuming we wish it to model years 1980 and on.   "

Non-linear functions have a non-constant rate of change, but it is still useful to attempt to study the way they change. In fact, a good portion of calculus addresses this particular question.  The best we can do right now is measure the average rate of change of a function over some interval. To do this, we measure the slope of a line joining two points on the graph called a secant line . In the graph below, I've sketched the secant line joining between and on the graph of .    Average Rate of Change  Suppose is a function defined on an interval . the average rate of change of on is The expression in is called a difference quotient .    Finding Average Rate of Change  Let's find the average rate of change of on the interval .  To do so, we evaluate the difference quotient of on .

Difference Quotients in Calculus  In calculus, we will want to consider the difference quotient over small intervals , where is a small non-zero amount. This puts the two points on the graph close together. The slope of this secant line does a good job of measuring the rate of change of the function at .

An angle in the plane consists of a vertex , an initial ray , and a terminal ray which we think of being obtained by rotating the initial ray some amount about the vertex. (There can be quite a lot of rotation as the dashed arrow indicates above. This is useful for engineering situations where angles are describing a rotating object over time.) If the rotation is counter clockwise, we will say the angle is positive ; if the rotation is clockwise, we say the angle is negative .      We'd like to measure the amount of rotation and hence the size of the angle with a real number typically denoted by a greek letter such as ( theta ). The preferred approach for calculus is to draw a circle of radius centered at the vertex of the angle and measure the arc-length  subtended by the angle, that is, the length of the curve that's formed around the circle as the initial ray is rotated to form the terminal ray.    Radian Measure of an Angle   The radian measure of the positive angle above is the ratio of arc-length to the radius If the angle is a negative angle, we will take the opposite sign for .     Angles are Dimensionless  Observe that is a ratio of lengths and therefore has no units. As such, angles are considered dimensionless quantities provided you are using the radian measure of the angle. This is one reason why using radians is the natural choice of measurement of angles in calculus and engineering.    Measuring an Angle in Radians   In the figure below, I've drawn a positive angle with vertex at the center of a circle with a radius of 2 inches. I measure around the arc formed by the angle with a piece of string and find it to be inches. The radian measure of the angle is then Note how the units of inches cancel leaving us with a quantity that has no physical units anymore. While it is perfectly appropriate to write without units, sometimes we might write only to provide context for how the measurement was made.  If we let ( tau ) be the same angle but with opposite rotation then (radians).    Of course, you are likely more familiar with using degrees to measure angles in everyday life. For practical purposes, it's important to be able to convert between the two. To start, an angle of is one revolution. In a circle of radius , one revolution will subtend an arc of length . Thus, Dividing both sides by two, So that, and Observe that a radian is significantly larger than a degree.  Converting between units  Convert radians to degrees   Remember, is radians. Use this as a conversion factor. Its useful to include radians as a unit when converting:    Usually we draw our angles on the -plane in standard position with the vertex at the origin and the initial ray along the positive -axis. The following angle is in standard position. Its terminal ray is in the second quadrant so we refer to this as a Quadrant II angle. The following figure illustrates angles in standard position and their quadrant.   A Quadrant III angle.     A Quadrant IV angle.     A Quadrant I angle.      Sketching an Angle  Consider in standard position. We'd like to draw picture accurate enough to determine the quadrant of . You should think of this as Now , so . This divides a full rotation into 8 equal parts. Starting at the positive -axis and going counter-clockwise, count out 15 of these parts until you arrive at the terminal side. The result is is a Quadrant IV angle.    Sketching an Angle  Draw the angle in standard position and determine its quadrant.  We have . Now, and this divides a full rotation into six equal parts. Count of in the clockwise orientation. We conclude that is a Quadrant I angle.    Sketching an Angle  Draw the angle in standard position and determine its quadrant.  Observe that divides one full rotation into 12 equal parts. Count out 13 of these in the counter-clockwise direction. Thus, is a Quadrant I angle.   Angles whose terminal sides coincide with a coordinate axis are called quadrantal angles and do not have a defined quadrant. For instance, is a quadrantal angle and so is half this amount . In fact, the quadrantal angles are precisely the integer multiples of .        Sketching Quadrantal Angles  Sketch in standard position.  We can write this as Sketching, we count two full clockwise revolutions and an extra quarter revolution. The result is a quadrantal angle.    Coterminal Angles  We say that two angles are coterminal if their terminal rays coincide when drawn in standard position.   Any angle is coterminal to infinitely many other angles, simply by adding or subtracting complete revolutions. However, it may be helpful to find the smallest positive or negative angle coterminal to a given angle as illustrated in the example below.  Finding Coterminal Angles  Consider from . Then is coterminal to and this is the smallest such negative angle. The smallest positive angle coterminal to is .       "

The video summarizes the content of this section.   A right triangle is a triangle containing one angle. The remaining two angles must be acute , i.e. they are positive angles less than . I've drawn a right triangle below with the acute angles labeled ( alpha ) and ( beta ). We call and  complementary angles as they sum to .

Finally, notice that the specific dimensions of the triangle I use to compute the trigonometric ratios is irrelevant: any right trianlge with these angles will result in the same ratios . For instance, if I draw in a right triangle with half the size the side lengths are all scaled by and the ratios remain unchanged.    Some of our observations from the previous examples are summarized below as trigonometric identities .
